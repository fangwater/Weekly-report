## Question
### 一致性问题
SSD Cache 直接从file system做到了FTL级别的优化\
在Twitter和Facebook的SSD cache都强调了一致性的问题，那么针对这种直接对channel的操作，相当于cache还是只有一层，但当没有进入chip级别的时候，是因为设计了合理的事物时间：
参考：\
To deal with that case, we use a delete hold-off, which is a special kind of delete that includes an expiration time. Memcached will prevent any new value from being set for this key until the delete has expired. This means that the stale set will actually need to be issued several seconds after the corresponding delete, which happens rarely enough to have no impact on overall cache consistency.\
在这种条件下，FTL级的操作应该延迟很低，采用的是惰性删除之类的方法来维持一致性？还是hold-off的办法？ 论文似乎没有强调？
